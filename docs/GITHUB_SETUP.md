# GitHub Setup Guide - Al-Awael Educational Platform

This guide will help you connect your Al-Awael Educational Platform to GitHub for version control, collaboration, and deployment.

## 🚀 Quick GitHub Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**
   - Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Sign in to your account (or create one if needed)

2. **Create New Repository**

   - Repository name: `al-awael-educational-platform`
   - Description: `Arabic-first educational platform for Sudanese students with multi-role dashboards, exam system, and points economy`
   - Make it **Public** (recommended for open source) or **Private**
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Project

Since you're working in Replit, you'll use these commands in the Shell:

1. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add All Files**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Create Initial Commit**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Al-Awael Educational Platform

   - Complete Arabic-first educational platform
   - Multi-role system (Student, Teacher, Admin, Institution, Parent)
   - Exam system with timers and automatic scoring
   - Points-based economy (1000 pts = 99 SDG)
   - Referral system with bonuses
   - PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
   - Replit authentication integration
   - RTL Arabic interface with Tailwind CSS"
   ```

4. **Add Remote Repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/al-awael-educational-platform.git
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

1. **Repository Description**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the gear icon (Settings)
   - Add description: "Arabic-first educational platform for Sudanese students"
   - Add topics: `education`, `arabic`, `sudan`, `react`, `typescript`, `postgresql`, `rtl`

2. **Branch Protection** (Recommended)
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"

3. **Issues and Projects**
   - Enable Issues for bug tracking and feature requests
   - Set up project boards for task management
   - Create issue templates for bug reports and features
